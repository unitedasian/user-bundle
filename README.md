UAMUserBundle
=============

Requirements
------------

This bundle requires the [FOSUserBundle](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSUserBundle) to be installed.

Installation
------------

Add the following to your project's `composer.json` file:

```yaml
	{
		require: {
			"uam/user-bundle": "dev-master"
		}
	}
```

Register the bundle:

```php
#app/AppKernel.php

	public function registerBundles()
    {
    	$bundles = array(
    		â€¦
    		new UAMUserBundle()
    	);

    	return $bundles;
    }
```

If you are using assetic, add the bundle to the assetic configuration:

	#config.yml
	assetic:
		UAMUserBundle

Also install FOSUserBundle as per the bundle's instructions.

Usage
-----
To override the templates, create the a `UAMUserBundle/views` directory under your app's `Resources` directory.

The `layout.html.twig` template is used by all pages generated by the bundle.

The `base.email.twig` template is used by all emails sent by the bundle.
